Typed `import this` on python command line

Copy pasted the output "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters" to 'Download dataset' on Rosalind

***##INI2***

`a=810`
`b=866`

`c**2 = (810**2) + (866**2)`

*Output* : c**2 = 1406056

Solved using pythagoras' theorem

`print(str[67:75], str[144:150])`

*Output*: Abantias duplex

Problem requires text in positions (67 to 74) and (144 to 149)

Since stop is exclusive in slicing, positions 75 and 150 are used, respectively, as stops in the code for the output to include positions 74 and 149
